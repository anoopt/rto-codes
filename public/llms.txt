# RTO Codes India

> A comprehensive, searchable database of Regional Transport Office (RTO) codes in India. Covers all 28 states and 8 Union Territories with detailed information and interactive maps.

## About This Site

RTO Codes India helps users understand vehicle registration numbers in India. Most Indian vehicles have a registration number in the format `XX-00(0)-XX-0000`, where:
- First two letters: State code (e.g., KA for Karnataka)
- Next two or three digits: RTO office code (e.g., 01 for Bangalore Central or 324 for Markapur)
- Remaining characters: Unique vehicle identifier

This site provides detailed information about each RTO office, including the region it serves, the district, and coverage area.

## Available Pages

- `/` - Homepage with searchable grid of all RTO codes
- `/rto/{code}` - Individual RTO detail page (e.g., `/rto/ka-01` for Bangalore Central)
