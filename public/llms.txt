# RTO Codes India

> A comprehensive, searchable database of Regional Transport Office (RTO) codes in India. Currently covering all 70 RTO codes in Karnataka with plans to expand to other Indian states.

## About This Site

RTO Codes India helps users understand vehicle registration numbers in India. Every Indian vehicle has a registration number in the format `XX-00-XX-0000`, where:
- First two letters: State code (e.g., KA for Karnataka)
- Next two digits: RTO office code (e.g., 01 for Bangalore Central)
- Remaining characters: Unique vehicle identifier

This site provides detailed information about each RTO office, including the region it serves, the district, and coverage area.

## Available Pages

- `/` - Homepage with searchable grid of all RTO codes
- `/rto/{code}` - Individual RTO detail page (e.g., `/rto/ka-01` for Bangalore Central)
- `/about` - About the project and data sources
- `/contribute` - How to contribute to the project

## Data Structure

Each RTO entry follows this JSON schema:

```json
{
  "code": "KA-01",           // RTO code (STATE-NUMBER format)
  "region": "Bangalore (Central)", // Region/area name
  "city": "Bangalore",       // Primary city
  "state": "Karnataka",      // Full state name
  "stateCode": "KA",         // Two-letter state code
  "district": "Bangalore Urban", // District name (optional)
  "description": "...",      // Detailed description (optional)
  "established": "1988",     // Year established (optional)
  "additionalInfo": "..."    // Coverage areas, pin codes (optional)
}
```

## Data Organization

Data is organized by state in the `/data` directory:
- `/data/karnataka/` - Karnataka RTO data files
- Each RTO has its own JSON file: `ka-01.json`, `ka-02.json`, etc.

Future expansion will add more states:
- `/data/tamil-nadu/` (planned)
- `/data/maharashtra/` (planned)
- etc.
